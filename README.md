## Background
Before moving into development, I worked as a **Systems Administrator** in post-production, managing infrastructure, servers, Docker environments, and automation with PowerShell and Google Workspace administration.

These experiences taught me how to stay calm under pressure, think logically, and engineer reliable solutions - skills I now bring into my software development journey.
